<p> <h2>North America Fortified Rice Market Drivers and Trends</h2><p>The growing prevalence of malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies in North America is a key driver for the fortified rice market. With rising awareness about the benefits of fortified foods, consumers and health organizations are increasingly advocating for the inclusion of fortified rice in diets. The government initiatives promoting food fortification to address public health concerns further contribute to the market’s growth. Additionally, the demand for easy-to-consume and nutrient-rich food products, especially among busy urban populations, supports the expansion of fortified rice in the region.</p><p>Another major trend driving the market is the growing focus on sustainability and health-conscious eating habits. Consumers are becoming more selective about their food choices, seeking options that not only enhance nutrition but also promote better overall health. Fortified rice, with its added vitamins and minerals, aligns with these preferences. Furthermore, as manufacturers continue to innovate with new fortification methods and enhanced rice varieties, the appeal of fortified rice grows among both health-conscious consumers and those seeking to support global health initiatives. This trend is expected to continue expanding in the coming years.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=503184&utm_source=GitHub-Jan&utm_medium=264" target="_blank">North AmericaFortified Rice Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;North AmericaFortified Rice Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Fortified Rice Market size was valued at USD 1.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 2.8 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 8.4% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;North AmericaFortified Rice Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Cargill</Li><Li> BÃ¼hler Group</Li><Li> Bunge</Li><Li> General Mills</Li><Li> Wilmar International</Li><Li> BASF</h3><h3 id="" class="">Global&nbsp;North AmericaFortified Rice Market Analysis of Segmentation</h3><p id="" class="">A wide range of product types tailored to specific applications, end-user industries from a variety of sectors, and a geographically diverse landscape that includes Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are some of the characteristics that set the North AmericaFortified Rice Market apart.
